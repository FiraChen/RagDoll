# RagDoll

There are two buttons on the left top corner:
  1. Reset: return the doll to its starting size, and position.
  2. About: Display a popup with application name, my name and student number.

The doll can be manipulated by:
  1. Touching and dragging torso will translate the doll.
  2. Touching and moving other parts will rotate the touched part.
  3. Pinch or spread legs using two fingers will scale the leg in the vertical direction around the focal point
        (horizontal scale won't change otherwise the doll will look strange), while feet will remain unchanged.
